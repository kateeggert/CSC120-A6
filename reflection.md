What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming? 

Unit testing allows me to fix bugs in coding. I think the act of making tests makes me think about the code in a way that allows me to catch many bugs without testing--bugs that I otherwise wouldn't have caught. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was definitely difficult to find every bug with the code, but I just worked slowly and looked at every method to try to figure out every bug. I would advise someone to start ahead of time, because this is a trickier assingment. Another thing I struggled with was testing the print statements, but someone in class also had the same question as me, which helped me figure it out. So I would also advise to ask questions!
